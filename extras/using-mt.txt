Initial Words
****************************
I, Ross Carlson (ross@jasbone.com), the author of this 
Add-on know very little about Movable Type outside of 
using it for my personal blog. If I've done something 
stupid please just let me know and I'll be happy to 
make it better.


Support
****************************
This add on is not supported officially in any way.  However
you are welcome to post in the Jinzora forums at
http://www.jinzora.org 
and I'll do my best to help out.  Please do not email
me with issues related to this, rather post in our
forums.


Example
****************************

Prerequisites
****************************
- A fully working installation of Jinzora 1.1PR2 or higher
- A general knowledge of Movable Type and Jinzora
- The ability to edit Movable Type templates
- Knowledge about Jinzora, namely the username you use to 
  log into Jinzora


Configuring the MT Add-on
****************************
- Edit one of your templates and add the following code.
  You'll add this code where you want the Jinzora
  Add-on to display
<?php
   $user = "Ross";
   $numItems = "5";
   $img_width = "125";
   $resample = "";
   $allow_plays = "true";
   $truncate = "25";

   include( "http://www.jasbone.com/dev/jinzora/extras/mt.php?user=". $user. "&numItems=". $numItems. "&img_width=". $img_width. "&resample=". $resample. "&allow_plays=". $allow_plays. "&truncate=". $truncate);

?>
where
	$user = your jinzora login username
	$numItems = the number of pervious items you want displayed
	$img_width = the width you'd like album art resized to
	$allow_plays = Can the user click on the items to generate playlists ("true" or "false")
	$truncate = The maximum length of item names to be displayed
	include = The FULL path to where Jinzora is installed (you can get this from your admin)

- You now MUST change your main template (index.html) to a PHP
  template by renaming it to index.php (you'll also want to delete
  the old index.html file or modify it to point at your new index.php)

- If you put the above code in a sidebar or other file that is
  included in by your index file you must also rename it to .php

- Rebuild your site

- That should do it!!!
